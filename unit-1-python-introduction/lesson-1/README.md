# Basic Data Types

Python is a general purpose programming language. It means that it can manage pretty much every common data type you might need. We'll do a quick review of each one of them:

- [Numbers](#numbers)
- [Strings](#strings)
- [Booleans](#booleans
- [Objects](#objects)
- [None / Nullable types](#none-nullable-types)

### Numbers

Numbers are mainly of two types - integers and floats.

An examples of an integer is 2 which is just a whole number.

Examples of floating point numbers (or floats for short) are 3.23 and 52.3E-4. The E notation indicates powers of 10. In this case, 52.3E-4 means 52.3 * 10^-4^.

### Strings

A string is a sequence of characters. Strings are basically just a bunch of words.

You will be using strings in almost every Python program that you write, so pay attention to the following part.
